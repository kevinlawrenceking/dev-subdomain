# Calendar Time Slot Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Calendar events were displaying as full-day events instead of respecting their actual time slots. This was caused by corrupted date/time data in the database where:

1. **End dates were before start dates** (e.g., start: 2025-05-23, end: 2025-01-23)
2. **End times were the same as start times** (causing zero-duration events)
3. **Missing end times or dates** (causing FullCalendar to extend events)

## Root Cause
The issue was in the calendar event generation logic in `app/assets/js/calendar2.cfm`, which was directly outputting database values without validation:

```cfml
end: "#dateFormat(events.eventstop, "yyyy-mm-dd")# #timeformat(events.eventstopTime, 'HH:mm')#",
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Logic Fix (`calendar2.cfm`)
Added validation and correction logic to ensure:
- End dates are never before start dates
- Missing end dates default to start date
- End times are always after start times (minimum 1-hour duration)
- Missing times get reasonable defaults

### 2. Database Cleanup Script (`admin-calendar-cleanup.cfm`)
Created a one-time cleanup script that:
- Fixes events where end date < start date
- Sets missing end dates to start date
- Ensures end times are after start times
- Provides default times for missing values
- Shows results and statistics

### 3. OAuth Scope Update
Updated Google Calendar OAuth scope from:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (full access)
- To: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` (events only)

This reduces "unsafe app" warnings by requesting minimal permissions.

## Files Modified

1. **`app/assets/js/calendar2.cfm`** - Added date/time validation logic
2. **`include/calendarSectionCalendar.cfm`** - Updated OAuth scope
3. **`admin-calendar-cleanup.cfm`** - Database cleanup script (new file)

## Testing & Verification

After running the cleanup script, you should see:
- ✅ Events display in proper time slots
- ✅ No more full-day spanning events (unless intentional)
- ✅ Consistent 1-hour minimum duration for meetings
- ✅ Reduced Google OAuth warnings

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the cleanup script once**: Visit `/admin-calendar-cleanup.cfm`
2. **Clear browser cache** to ensure fresh calendar data
3. **Refresh calendar page** to see corrected events
4. **Test creating new events** to ensure they display correctly

## Prevention

The frontend validation in `calendar2.cfm` will prevent future data corruption by:
- Automatically correcting invalid date/time combinations
- Ensuring minimum event durations
- Handling missing data gracefully

This fix ensures that calendar events respect their actual time slots and display properly in the FullCalendar interface.
