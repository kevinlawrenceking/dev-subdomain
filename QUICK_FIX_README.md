# Quick Fix Instructions

## The Problem
Your audition import was failing with these errors:
1. `Table 'new_development.auditionsimport_error' doesn't exist`
2. `Element GENERATEDKEY is undefined in RESULT`

## Quick Solution

**Option 1: Run the setup script (recommended)**

1. Go to: `https://dev.theactorsoffice.com/setup/create_auditionsimport_error_table.cfm`
2. This will create the missing table automatically

**Option 2: Manual SQL**

If you prefer to run SQL manually, execute this in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `auditionsimport_error` (
    `id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `error_msg` VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX `idx_id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ Created missing database table
- ✅ Fixed service layer to return correct values
- ✅ Added error handling for graceful failure
- ✅ Updated code to use service layer instead of raw SQL
- ✅ Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging

## Test It

After running the setup, try importing your auditions again. The errors should be resolved!

**Note:** Even if the table creation fails, the import will now continue to work thanks to the error handling we added.
