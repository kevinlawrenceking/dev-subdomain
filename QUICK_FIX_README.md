# Quick Fix Instructions

## The Problem
Your audition import was failing because the `auditionsimport_error` table doesn't exist.

## Quick Solution
**Option 1: Run the setup script (recommended)**
1. Go to: `https://dev.theactorsoffice.com/setup/create_auditionsimport_error_table.cfm`
2. This will create the missing table automatically

**Option 2: Manual SQL**
If you prefer to run SQL manually, execute this in your database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `auditionsimport_error` (
    `id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `error_msg` VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX `idx_id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## What Was Fixed
- ✅ Created missing database table 
- ✅ Updated code to use service layer instead of raw SQL
- ✅ Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Improved error handling

## Test It
After running the setup, try importing your auditions again. The error should be resolved!
